## 🔐 Cybersecurity Skills

### ✅ Risk, Vulnerability & Incident Handling
- Conducted **3 security audits** involving control documentation, risk registers, and compliance requirements
- Performed full **vulnerability assessments** using NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 methodology
- Created **risk scoring models** (likelihood × severity), wrote full remediation plans
- Used **incident handler's journal** to document ransomware incident response

### 📈 Threat Detection & Logging
- Used **Wireshark** and `tcpdump` to capture and analyze network packets
- Queried logs with **Splunk** and **Chronicle**
- Filtered security events by **country and IP range**
- Verified logs and files with **hashing (SHA256)** to detect tampering/malware

### 🧮 SQL for Threat Hunting
- Filtered and joined databases to correlate alerts with user behavior
- Queried for suspicious activity from specific geolocations
- Inserted/tested alerts and parsed logs using `JOIN`, `LIKE`, `WHERE`, and aggregate functions
- Explained real-world benefits of SQL for security operations

### 🔐 Access Controls & USB Threat Simulations
- Investigated shared access, lack of revocation, and audit failures in small businesses
- Simulated USB baiting attack in a **virtualized lab** to test safe device isolation
- Recommended **MFA, RBAC, zero trust**, and cloud ACL improvements

### 🧠 Encryption & Decryption
- Decrypted messages with **Caesar cipher** using `tr` and Linux tools
- Used `openssl aes-256-cbc` to reverse encrypted files
- Learned symmetric vs asymmetric encryption and key-based file recovery
